Adventure!
----------
A text-based game for students of java.
This version is my attempt at a good clean solution
that I can based the assignment write-up off of.

This students in this semester have typically been given a layout to adhere to.
I intend to create a good structure so that the path to dev is clear to students,
and also to ensure that my assumptions about the structure are valid.

Goals:
Only use tools from CSC15 ch1-5 (no custom objects or arrays)

Input:
  Should be given as text and handled by a scanner.
  Students should use a switch-case to route the commands to the correct handler

output:
  a description of the situation should be printed to the screen
  whenever a hero changes rooms/caves/dungeons/whatever
  beginning rooms should teach the user their available commands

  unfortunately, every item's state must be tracked by variables for now.
  this means e should have few items.
