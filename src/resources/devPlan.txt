Adventure!
----------
A text-based game for students of java.
This version is my attempt at a good clean solution
that I can based the assignment write-up off of.

This students in this semester have typically been given a layout to adhere to.
I intend to create a good structure so that the path to dev is clear to students,
and also to ensure that my assumptions about the structure are valid.

Goals:
Only use tools from CSC15 ch1-5 (no custom objects or arrays)

Input:
  Should be given as text and handled by a scanner.
  Students should use a switch-case to route the commands to the correct handler

output:
  a description of the situation should be printed to the screen
  whenever a hero changes rooms/caves/dungeons/whatever
  beginning rooms should teach the user their available commands

  unfortunately, every item's state must be tracked by variables for now.
  this means e should have few items.

Structure:
	The world will be represented by a 2d array of rooms. Each room name will be stored in indices based on the map.
	The room's features will be fetched from methods that take the name of the room and the piece of data to return.
	[room][Description|exits|items|coordinates] 
	The room names will be local constants for integers to facilitate clean naming

public static int BED = 1;
rooms[BED][DESCRIPTION] should give the description of the bedroom.
